                                        <br>Even before I finished the UX course I search for a job in it. I sent on a daily basis my resume to countless companies, hoping for a chance. I tried to also talk with UX people using contacts, LinkedIn and even Facebook. Most of the time I received the words "Give up". I had to build my own portfolio and make it impressive enough to at the very least capture attention. But than some head of UX asked me if I heard about "Product management", he said that from the very short time we talked, he believed that it will suit me better.
                                        <br>For me, it was quit the plot twist. Yes, I did learn a very basic product management in the Game design course, but the teacher there pretty much taught us things we already learn in the game design and the ux\ui parts of the course. Therefore, I never given it much thought.
                                        <br>At that same day I heard that it might be more suited to me, I started to read what I can about what is Product Manager. Imagine my supprise from what I saw, it really did sound like it was better suited for me; It had so many similarities to the Game Designer and the UX\UI Designer (which I already wanted to do), and I believed that it was better suited to my personality.
                                        <br>In the course I learn about how to write Product Requirements Document, how to discover the users' needs, how to analyze competitor's products, how to use Figma to create a mockup, what is lean methodology, how to use Trello to better prioritize features and bug fixing in each sprint, how to read cohort diagram, create gantt table and road map.

                                        <br>After the Game Design course, we were instructed to choose one field to focus on. I chose the UX\UI subject. I have never felt so strongly before how easy it is for me to understand the material, it was so "obvious", so "logical" that I didn't even hesitate.
                                        <br>During the course I learned about the five UX elements: Strategy, Scope, Structure, Skeleton and Surface. Those elements are directly connected to the creation process of any digital product.

                                        <br>Did you ever experience a feeling of enlightenment, in which afterwards you knew exactly what you want? Well, I certainly did.
                                        <br>Back then I tried to do a B.A in Electrical Engineering and failed (I can't learn so many things simultaneously in the way that universities demand from us). The failure left me discourage and lost, but then in one morning, I just woke up "knowing" what is it that I want to do: I want to work in the game industry.
                                        <br>It was so obvious! I am a gamer, what possible job could give me more satisfaction than working and help creating one? Mind you, I didn't fool myself thinking it will be easy, but it was a direction that really excited me.
                                        <br>In this course, which had 3 semesters, we got a taste from pretty much all the possible fields: Game Design, Level design, Game's narrative, Programing using Unity, Art in games, Adobe Photoshop, Sounds in games, 3D modeling using Autodesk Maya and even the basics of creating board games.

                                        <br>After I worked a few years as a PC technician, I decided to try and develop myself further. At first, I had my site on learning Cyber-security, but very quickly I realize that this field is not for me. The pressure of learning all the time, the responsibility, all of it was too much for the 24 years old me. I wasn't ready for it yet.
                                        <br>Thus, in the end I went for what I saw at the time as "one level lower"- Network management.
                                        <br>In the course, I learned about Microsoft Servers, about different types of network protocols, on Active Directory tree and even on Virtual machines (on which we practice creating organization's network layouts). On the second half we learn about Cisco switches, but at that point I started to lose interest. I understood that this job won't provide me with the same satisfaction as Helpdesk or PC technician will, and finished the course only to complete it rather than actually using this knowledge. Ironically enough, I was the one who graduated with honors in that course.

                                        <br>I just finished the army, and return from my "big trip". I asked myself over and over "Now what do I do?", in the end I decided to learn about computers. I always remember as a child, going with my mother to the computer lab whenever the computer had an issue and the awe I felt toward the people who fixed it.
                                        <br>Therefore, I started the course and had a really good time; I really liked learning about the computer's components, about how the software and Operating Systems work and how to fix computer's problem such as drivers, network and even registry work. I was almost sad that the course was over... And I was one of the top student in that class.
