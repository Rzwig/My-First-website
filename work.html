                                After I was fired from Ben Gurion airport due to the Corona virus first curfew, I had a really hard times. I was unemployed for months, eventually I found a job in Ramat-Gan Safari as en entrance fee collector, after the third curfew I found a job at Superfarm as the pharmacy shelf organizer.
                                <br>Well, you get the idea. Even before I was fired from Ben Gurion I had my site only for jobs in "Game" companies (back than I didn't care at all in what position, I just wanted in). When I finished the Game design course and started the UX Design course, I worked really hard on my portfolio and try to search for any Junior UX\UI position (not necessarily in games companies), which later on turned to focus on Product management positions.
                                <br>My highlight in this period was when I manage to find a job in a startup game company as a Game Tester. I left a pretty good position at Shekel Group for that, and worst of all- since I didn't had any experience they gave me a contract which state that there is no employee-employer relationship. Meaning that I "volunteer" to work for them. However, the contract also state that if they'll be satisfied from my work after six weeks, they will replace it with a normal contract... Now, you're probably thinking right now "They played you for a fool", and well you are probably right; I was fired after only three weeks, and that was because I asked too many questions (which was looked by the CEO and the CTO as defiance). But you know what? I craved for the experience, and more importantly, I NEVER ENJOYED as much to go to work. This short experience, this small taste, was enough to show me that I really do want this.
                                <br><br>Today, I'm working for over half a year now at Afcon group as a Tier 1 helpdesk, and I admit that I'm not amused nor thrill at all. My "Dream" job goal is still to find a position of Product manager in a game company (and preferably an educational games' developer), but I learned lesson; Currently I put my sight on becoming a QA and automation. I hope that I will like those positions and that will be the end of it, but I will not give up on my goal unless I find something else that give me the same sensation I had before.

                            <h3 class="h5 date-title">PC technician - Elbit Systems</h3>
                            <p>
                                Two years have passed since I left Teva, and I just finished my "first academic year". My average score were around 80 (which is VERY good overall), but my pace was very slow. So slow in fact, that I was summoned to the Department of Electricity in the university, where I was warned that I can't continue like this anymore.
                                <br>I enrolled in 4 courses per semester at the time, the department wanted me to take 7 courses starting the first semester of the second year. After a few days of arguing with them, I had to dropped out of the B.A.
                                <br>Well, that was a mess... I gave up a very nice position because I was too ambitious and too impatient. "Now what?" I thought, obviously I had to look for a proper job and not only the temporary part-time jobs I had during the B.A.
                                <br>I was lucky, I found a job around two weeks later, in Ben Gurion airport as "Gev Systems" contract worker for Elbit Systems.
                                <br>In this job I was charge with managing and maintaining all the bio-metric stations as well as the Border Control's PC network within Ben-Gurion Airport and the rest of Israel's border controls (land, air and sea). My job this time was to provide support both remotely and on-the-spot; Remotely for all the other borders control, if possible even inside the Terminal itself. On-the-spot support was confide to Terminal 3 and occasionally Terminal 1.
                                <br>I had a bad taste in my mouth concerning to this job, I felt defeated, forced to go back instead of moving forward. However, it wasn't all bad; The job was interesting- I had deal with a problems that can be both software and hardware from time to time, and I had to work closely to the QA there in order to figure out the exact problem. I learned there how to read logs, and how to try getting to the bottom of the problem in order to fix it. Plus, since the airport is working 24/7, I had plenty of night shifts and Saturdays that were very "quiet".
                                <br>At that point I had the <a href="education.html#enlightenment">idea</a> of learning Game design, and those "quiet" shifts really help me to learn while working as well as boosting my salary. My life seemed like it returned to normal.
                                <br>Or did it? well, in March 20th 2020 the Corona virus had come to Israel, and the entire team I was at was sent to a non-pay vacation. At first I was actually happy (I didn't have a vacation in a long time, not considering the unemployed time), but exactly one month later at April 20th I (and the entire team) were fired...

                            <h3 class="h5 date-title">Knowledge Manager - Teva Pharmaceuticals</h3>
                            <p>
                                After 3 months in the computer lab I was back to the call center, a significantly less appealing job. I'm not going to lie, I was upset; "I did a great job and got demoted because of it? it's so unfair!" is what I thought at the time... Today I obviously understand that manager decision- I was but a recourse, which was used in the wrong way and therefore wasted. However, I still took it as a lesson; Never do an excellent job if you have something to lose.
                                <br>Well, upset or not, I still got a job, and let us not forget that I was considered a temporary employee. Thus, I moved back to the call center without any fuss or arguing. I got calls from all of Teva's sites (back than they had around 7 or 8 sites), and my job was to solve as many problems as I could remotely. If for any reasons I couldn't solve it remotely, I had to transfer that case to the appropriate team which can help the user.
                                <br>To pass my shifts better, I played games with myself. I kept a record of the most "perfect" user id numbers, and I challenge myself every day with beating my own record of closing more tickets a day. Two months have passed like that, when the call center manager suddenly came to me; He asked my if I still planned to transfer to the IAI when I'll get my clearance, I told him that that is still the plan when he surprised me- "If I'll get you a promotion, will you consider to stay here in Teve?"
                                <br>Suffice to say that I didn't even hesitate. I was really flattered and honoured to know that someone does see me doing my best and appreciate me. And besides, at that point I had close to six months of seniority in Teva, why would I transfer to a new company that offered me the exact same conditions, but where I had to (once again) be the new guy who need to learn all the systems from scratch? Not to mentioned that at that point I had friends in Teva while in the IAI I didn't know anyone...
                                <br><br>After Calanit approved this promotion and canceled my nomination to the IAI, just as he promised me, I got promoted to be the Israeli's tech support Knowledge Manager. This job came with several responsibilities: I had to overlap new call center workers and prepare them to the job, I had to produce on a monthly basis detailed KPI reports (using Excel and PowerPoint), I was the one who had to call the ServiceNow (an ERP system) support when there were problems, I was responsible for the tech support's local knowledge base (meaning- update existing technical guide or create new ones).
                                <br>Is that all? of course not :) Officially my direct manger was the systems' manager, but unofficially I also worked under a Product Manager (I didn't know that at the time of course), who was responsible for implementing a globally shared knowledge database via the ServiceNow system. That's mean that I had to participate every week in an international meeting with all the other Teva's knowledge managers in the world, and report about how "my" tech support is using the new system. I didn't know it at that time, but that experience was golden opportunity for me to witness a process of implanting a new feature in a product.
                                <br>Well, unfortunately it didn't go well. The system was buggy, and it was tough for the users (the call center workers) to get used to it, so they always returned to the old "local" system. Furthermore, not all the call centers in the world used the same programs; so for example when I wrote a guide for a specific problem, a user from Canada criticised it as being "absolutely worthless". We couldn't find a solution for this in the meetings, after all this guide will be visible to the entire world and it was relevant only to Israel... It will take too long and too much time to add a feature of "nationality" to each and every technical guide,in the end the project was dropped.
                                <br>After a few more months, Teva's own situation as an organization became very shaky (read about it if you're curious), and I realize that I have reached the top of my potential there. Looking backwards, it was a mistake on my part, but I started then to strongly feel that I lost my way and that I'm not happy.
                                <br>About one month as passed with me trying to figure out what do I want from myself, I already completed at that time my Network Management course and new that this is not for me. But wait, maybe this is it? At that time the Ministry of Employment advertise a free Electric technician course for veterans who were released up to 5 years. At first, it was tempting to take this course; Even if I wasn't planning to work at it, knowledge is power.
                                <br>After some thought, I decide to take it to one more step and do a B.A in Electrical Engineering. Why did I do that? well, for one thing because I was the only one in my family (first-level) who didn't have a degree, and I also thought: "I love working with pc hardware right? I saw that software is less for me, so why not become an engineer who develop hardware (like Nvidia Video-card, or smartphone's features). And that is why I was unable to keep my job in Teva, and had to quit 2 months afterwards.

                            <p>
                                When I left Nir school, it was originally supposed to be for the Israel Aerospace Industries (IAI) as Calanit's contract worker. I was accepted pretty easily if I may say so myself, but my mistake was to not hear that I require for this job security clearance; Which will take somewhere between half a year to a year.
                                <br>When I realize that I had a choice to make: I can stay\return at Nir school (they told me themselves that I'm more than welcome back), or I can try to find a different option. The first one was tempting, but I wanted to start earn a little and preferred to not take a second job (the taxes are not worth it). So I called Calanit, and asked them if they have another position that I can take temporarily until I get me clearance.
                                <br>And that was when they offered me to work at Teva Pharmaceuticals's call center. On my second week, there was a serious power outage that completely paralyze the all call center for two hours. When the power finally come back the shift manager told me that I can go home for that day because there was no one who had the time to "show me the ropes".
                                <br>I remember myself thinking "Go home now? why should I?", so I walked into the computer lab down the hall and offer them any assistant that I can. At first, they were skeptic, but they still allowed me to help them. Apparently I did a good job, because they asked the system manager if I can be transferred to work with them.
                                <br>I loved working in that lab as much as I loved working in Nir school. We were charge with fixing computers' hardware problems, backups, computers' and computers' accessories logistics and preparing the computers of new Teva's employees. The guys were great, the job intrigued me, and around 3 months later I became so efficient at it that the lab literally had nothing to do...
                                <br>How come you asked? well, as a young guy full of energy, I didn't wait for several assignment to pile up before going out like the rest of them, EVERY assignment was completed after around an hour. As mentioned, I learned to be very efficient in the process that my record was handling no less than 8 laptops simultaneously. We completed all the tasks we had, and to this day I remember that we spend a whole day sitting calmly and idly, talking and laughing.
                                <br>Naturally, it didn't last. The day after we sat and laugh I was summoned to the systems manager office, and he told me that apparently there is too many people at the lab and that he transfer me once again to the call center.

                            <p>
                                In this job I worked as the personal "PC guy" of the entire school, and therefore responsible for all the "technology" in the school.
                                <br>Computers? - obviously, printers? - why not?, but there was also the whole school's network, keyboard, mouses, projectors,sound speakers and even the secretaries IP desk-phone.
                                <br>Furthermore, I was charge in the technology logistics of the school; Meaning that if there was a need for a new pc, it was up to me to gather price offers from suppliers and order them.
                                <br>Last but not least, my job also included provide the teachers with any support they needed (related to computer), so if one of the teachers needed a hand in creating a Microsoft PowerPoint presentation they contact me, and the school also worked with a web educational systems which required me to be present in the class and provide the students support.
                                <br>I really loved this job; Be it the teachers, the janitor, the secretaries or the principle, they were all very nice and appreciate me. Unfortunately, it was a 50% job with a very low pay grade. I took it mostly to gain experience.
