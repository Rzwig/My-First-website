                                <p>
                                    I started out learning Mui Thai, I learned it for two years during the age of 14-15. Later, I decided to change to Krav Maga and couldn't like it more.
                                    <br> Unfortunately, I had to stopped go there in the last few years because I didn't have the time to fully train, but I plan to return or find another martial art as soon as possible.

                                <p>
                                    With its beauty and variety, our world can put any artwork to shame, and one of my dreams was to be able to see all of it... The fact that I can't actually do it, is one of my deepest regrets.
                                    <br> <u>I categorize my vecations into 2 categories:</u> <b>Travel</b> and <b>Relaxation</b>.
                                    <br>#  <b>Travel-</b> Is when my goal is to see and do all that I can. I need to walk, climb or travel to as many places as I can and do as much as I can in the given time of the trip.
                                    <br>#  <b>Relaxation-</b> Is when I simply want to take my time and enjoy myself. Here I don't prioritise the "Do as much as I can" attitude, and focus more on "what I'd like to do better".

                                    Spoiler, the books in the picture are not the only ones I have nor that I read.
                                    <br>I love fantasy. Reading about different worlds, about heroes, monsters, gods and variety of abilities and powers can really take me a way. I read plenty of books, Mangas, Manhwa and novels so far, and I plan on reading a hell of a lot more in the future.
                                </p>
                            </div>

                                <p>
                                    Did I mentioned I like fantasy? it doesn't apply only to reading. I also like to watch movies, tv shows and anime.
                                    <br>However, nothing gives me as much pleasure as games. I build my gaming pc by myself (took me a whole day to do it right), and I also own a Nintendo switch as well Playstation 2 - 5. (I didn't play my PS2 and PS3 in years therefore I'm not sure if they still work, but I have them and all my old games nonetheless).
                                    <br>Nonetheless, while it's true that I love playing "Video games", thanks to me being immersed in the games' story, I couldn't call myself a gamer if I wouldn't play board and cards games. I have at least 20 of them :)

                                <p>
                                    It's not really a hobby, but there is nothing more precious to me than my family.
                                    <br>We travel together, eating dinner together almost every Friday, and help each other all the time. I love hanging around them, and it's basically my job to play with all of my nephews.
